Rapid (2 week) laboratory screening assays were developed and shown to determine sensitive and statistically robust differences in susceptibility between grass varieties.

        abstract = {Understanding the seasonal biology of pasture mealybug is key to informing management of dieback. Mealybug behaviour is strongly seasonal with a narrow window for management of leaf feeding instars. The early instar leaf feeding stages through spring and summer, (especially after rain) are the life stages which cause loss of pasture production and induce classic PD symptoms. Mealy bug is not found in dead grass.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? The pasture mealybug Heliococcus summervillei is found associated with many C4 grasses and sugar cane. Molecular characterisation of pasture mealybug using historical samples and fresh material indicates that since 2016 (Atherton- QLD) a new biotype is found associated with the recent dieback infestations. This biotype is similar to the variant of H. summervillei found associated with sugarcane in Pakistan (described by Brooks).{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? In laboratory/screen house pot trials using buffel, bisset, Rhodes and panic grass infestations of mealybugs even at very low numbers can reproduce all observed symptoms of dieback (time lapse video).{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Field sampling at 40 sites across QLD and NSW demonstrates that mealybug is found associated with early-stage symptoms of dieback and the abundance of mealybug numbers is correlated with the severity of dieback symptoms. Mealybug is not found at dieback sites where grass is dead. {--} this relates to the seasonal behaviour and foliar-feeding of early instars of both sexes.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Mealybug is a sap sucking pest and saliva injected into the plant host delivers molecules which interfere with plant defence pathways. Metabolic analysis shows within 24 hours of instar feeding, the plant jasmonate pathway is down regulated and salicylic acid pathway upregulated. Additionally, plant sugars are also mobilised. [Data not presented]{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Plants are rendered susceptible to opportunistic infection by a range of secondary pathogens, which cause the typical ashy grey symptoms at death. Fusarium species may play a role in this with Fusarium load affecting prospects for pasture regeneration. [Data not presented]{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Mealybug life cycle in the laboratory is exclusively sexual. Mature females are mainly found in the crown and thatch of grasses during warmer and wetter seasons where they mate and produce young. Adult females turn pink when mated, they do not feed, but disperse by crawling to lay eggs, hiding in thatch, crown or soil- especially in response to cold or dry. Males pupate at third instar, they are winged, extremely small and dispersed by flying and wind. They do not feed.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Early instars move rapidly onto leaves and feed actively during warmer, moist conditions and spring/summer flushes of grass growth. This is the life stage which causes damage to pasture production. They are dispersed by wind.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Between Jun- Dec mealybugs retreat to under thatch or underground. White females have been observed over wintering with large egg masses. This may indicate parthenogenic reproduction in the field.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Systematic sampling using 50 m transects X 10 or 5 sampling points (each 25 x 30 cm squares of soil) and hand lens can be used to efficiently to monitor for field populations of mealybug. The peak season for abundance on leaf is in warmer months after rain. {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}? Application of the pesticides Imidacloprid (Confidor) or Spirotetramat (Movento) in screenhouse or field trials are effective at controlling mealybug and PD symptoms. Rate trials and residue trials have been conducted in collaboration with Bayer (including new active Sivanto). Pasture recovery is correlated with residual numbers of mealybug. Movento at half the recommended label rate is just as effective. Bayer will develop an application to APVMA for a minor use permit for Movento at half current permit rate.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}}

The large-footed myotis (Myotis macropus) is a trawling bat with a specialisation for foraging directly over water surfaces and movement across landscapes is restricted to riparian corridors. This species has adapted to roosting and breeding in concrete culverts under roads. However, little is known about the roost selection of these artificial sites and how much gene flow occurs between individuals roosting in an urban environment. We investigated M. macropus roost selection at two spatial scales and population structure in a large subtropical city in eastern Australia. We surveyed 365 concrete culverts, identified 23 roosts and collected wing tissue samples from 72 bats. {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}Using generalized additive models, we found the distribution of M. macropus roosts in concrete culverts can be predicted at a landscape level using the variables stream order, channel width and waterway density, and culvert height. Bats preferred culverts {\ensuremath{>}}1.2 m in height, and a preference for box culverts was detected although pipe culverts were also occupied. Predictive modelling identified that culvert roosts were a limited resource with only 5.5\% of culverts identified as potential roosts. {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}We examined roost selection at the roost scale by comparing roost culverts to available culverts.

These findings suggest that disturbance to, or removal of, a culvert containing a roost has the potential to be a significant impact to an urban population of M. macropus. Disturbance impacts are not equal across culvert roosts, and the impact of disturbance can be partially alleviated by increasing the number of culverts available for roosting. Road networks provide an opportunity to provide permanent roost sites for M. macropus. Additional culvert roost sites can be created by providing microhabitat in existing culverts by simply leaving lift holes unsealed, and this would increase the availability of urban culvert roosts. Increasing the amount of potential roost habitat available will maintain landscape and genetic connectivity and contribute to the viability of urban M. macropus populations.}

Common bee symbionts are known to comprise most of the T. carbonaria microbiome, however broader patterns of diversity in microbial community structure and function between and within hives remain under-investigated. Related hives kept by beekeepers in different environments were identified, and the microbiota of bees from these hives was profiled using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. This amplicon data was explored at the highest resolution possible, and microsatellite profiling of the bee hosts was used to assess the link between genetic and microbial community relatedness.We use T. carbonaria to explore the possibility of phylosymbiosis at the subspecies level, and contrast patterns observed from known symbiotic bacteria of bees with other, likely environmentally derived, microbiota.Furthermore, we discuss progress in elucidating functional implications of this symbiont diversity through untargeted metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.",

These provisions harbour a diverse microbiome, including bacteria and fungi, that can contribute to improved nutritional value and preservation and thus to the overall health of the bee colony. Chemical analyses of Australian pot-pollen have suggested that some bioactive volatiles might originate from microbial fermentation. The gut microbiota of Australian Meliponini has been studied, but the microbiota associated with their nests remains unexplored. In this study, fungi and yeasts were isolated using selective high-osmolarity media and antibacterial agents from pot-pollen, pot-honey, brood cell walls ({\textquoteleft}cerumen{\textquoteright}) and food provisions from nine colonies of three Australian Meliponini species (Tetragonula carbonaria, T. hockingsi and Austroplebeia australis) located at the same site in South East Queensland.

The relative abundance of bacteria in pot-pollen was estimated from 16S {\textquoteleft}barcodes{\textquoteright} by PCR amplification and Next Generation Sequencing using the MiSeq platform. Organisms identified include Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria previously unreported in nest materials of Australian Meliponini.

  abstract = "The use of meta-barcoding enables high-resolution insights into the metagenomes of various organisms that cannot be accomplished with conventional wet-lab techniques or shot-gun ‘next generation sequencing’ (NGS). Targeted NGS of the taxonomically significant 16S rRNA meta-barcode was used to identify and determine relative abundance of bacterial strains within the termite microbiome. A recently developed meta-barcoding software pipeline called ‘IMGGAP’ was used to produce a high-resolution map of these bacterial strains. This pipeline produces a sequence database based on polymorphisms identified within a dataset, enabling the production of meta-barcodes that are more highly resolved than those produced with pipelines that cluster reads based on sequence similarity. It was revealed by this analysis that the samples were dominated by bacteria of the phylum Fibrobacteres. Also revealed by the analysis was the greater degree of bacterial diversity that exists within termites of the worker caste compared to soldier termites of the same species.",
