  abstract  = "Pasture dieback causes unhealthy growth and death in a range of introduced and native grasses across Queensland and into northern NSW, resulting in large losses in beef production areas. Pasture mealybug, Heliococcus summervillei Brookes, has been identified as the primary cause of pasture dieback. Screening of potential controls for the mealybug, and methods to conduct those screens, are required to identify insecticide control options. Dose response bioassays are also required to support applications to APVMA for minor use permits. This requires data on efficacy and residues.Two emergency permits (for Imidacloprid and Spirotetramat (Movento, Bayer) were obtained from APVMA. Methods to conduct standardised bioassays to determine efficacy of insecticides were developed. These were used in artificially-infested screenhouse trials, and 4 replicated field trials to determine efficacy of a range of products, and application rates of Movento. Residue tests were established with Eurofins and Bayer. Data will be compiled and submitted to APVMA to obtain a minor use permit for Movento.The impact and timing of dieback from initial infestation with mealybug to death of grass were determined in laboratory and screenhouse experiments. Symptoms appear rapidly within a week of infestation, and at very low numbers of mealybugs, possibly as low as 1 bug per plant. Death of the grass was slow to occur. Grasses tolerate high numbers of mealybugs through early summer without immediate death.The population of mealybugs increases from December through to March, a pattern also observed in the field (B.PAS 0004). The actual death of the grass, with the appearance of {\textquoteleft}dieback{\textquoteright} did not occur until the wetter weather in late summer, when the peak in numbers of early and medium, foliar-feeding instars coincides with wet weather. This is when the combination of mealybugs (which disrupt the plant{\textquoteright}s immune responses) and conditions favourable to fungal infection coincide, resulting in the dramatic and apparently sudden death of grass with all the symptoms of {\textquoteleft}pasture dieback{\textquoteright}. Mealybug numbers declined rapidly in the screenhouses through March and April as cooler, wetter conditions continued and the amount of live grass for feeding decreased.These findings are important for both management and conduct of research trials. Firstly, there is a very short window in which trials can be conducted, between emergence of summer populations feeding on leaves and the decline in numbers from late February. Secondly, infested grasses, while symptomatic, do not {\textquoteleft}die back{\textquoteright} until the late summer abundance of mealybugs and wet weather combine to create the apparently sudden {\textquoteleft}dieback{\textquoteright} of grass. Finally, leaves with symptoms (yellow, red or purple streaking) don{\textquoteright}t recover: grass must be actively growing to recover. These effects combine to give graziers a window to monitor and then manage mealybugs and reduce {\textquoteleft}dieback{\textquoteright}. Pesticides are only one part of possible dieback management. Costs, withholding periods (subject to residue testing) and impracticality of application over large areas limit their overall use. They remain useful in spot-treatment of emerging spring populations to reduce later, more severe, summer infestation. Pesticides are, however, a useful tool for research.Monitoring for symptoms and presence of mealybugs from spring (September) is important detect early-season populations. Management such as crash grazing, slashing, or insecticides (if appropriate) can then be targeted to disrupt the mating and feeding populations in summer. Timing of management interventions to maximise efficacy needs further investigation.",

Pasture mealybug, Heliococcus summervillei Brookes, is the primary cause of pasture dieback.

Seasonal scouting is critical to targeting and management of mealybugs . Seasonal management such as slashing should target vulnerable mating adults and foliar-feeding early instars during late spring and summer. Further research on integrating management strategies (slashing, grazing, insecticides) with the seasonal and reproductive biology of the mealybug to quantify impact on susceptible mealybug populations and benefits within farm practice is strongly recommended.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}Transcriptome analysis demonstrated the mechanism of disruption of the jasmonic acid/salicylic acid pathway by which feeding by the mealybug renders the grass susceptible to pathogens such as Fusarium, resulting in {`}pasture dieback{'}. Interactions between the mealybug, its microbial symbionts, and the plant should be studied further to understand these mechanisms more clearly and to identify pathways of resistance or tolerance in pasture varieties.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}Analysis of small RNAs identified a number of viruses in plant material that might be amplified as a result of this suppression. No Closteroviruses, which are amplified in Mealybug-induced Pineapple Wilt disease, were found, but the interaction between disruption of the grass immune response and possible amplification of endogenous viruses requires further study.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}Natural enemies of the mealybug were identified by collection of live mealybugs and cadavers, and systematic sampling techniques were evaluated. Two parasitoids were identified, one a new record for Australia and one, the most abundant, a new species of genus Parectromoidella (Hymenoptera, Encyrtidae). Parasitoids are widely distributed and appear to have alternative hosts resulting in greater abundance of the wasps in early spring, but they cannot be relied on to control the pasture mealybug at current levels of abundance. Augmentation of beneficial insects is an important area for further investigation.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}The confirmation of H. summervillei as the causal agent of pasture dieback is of critical importance to industry. Graziers and agronomists can now move forward with confidence to identify management strategies that suit their farm operations. {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}The identification of key points in the seasonal and reproductive biology of the mealybug during which damage occurs and management can be targeted is critically important. These findings and the quantitative methods developed, will inform current management and development of proven strategies suitable for a range of farm operating models and systems. {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}},

This showed that gasses from healthy and dieback/mealybug -affected grasses have different chemical profiles. (E)-2-hexen-1-ol was associated with affected grasses. Variability between site and grass species in field conditions requires further experimental analysis to determine component markers. An extension of submission of the final report (without additional funding) is requested to complete this work.The results indicate that portable gas collection is feasible in the field, and that VOC analysis may have some value in detecting early-stage dieback. We propose a short extension in final reporting to conclude some experiments.",

  title     = "Resistant grass varieties and endophytes",
  abstract  = "Pasture dieback causes unhealthy growth and death in a range of introduced and native grasses across Queensland and into northern New South Wales, resulting in large losses in beef production areas. Pasture mealybug, Heliococcus summervillei Brookes, has been identified as the leading cause of pasture dieback.Possible management strategies include the identification of resistant or tolerant pasture varieties, and the use of endophytic fungi (both seed born and facultative) to protect pasture grasses possibly in association with pasture mixes including legumes. In New Zealand, pasture dieback in rye grass caused by the mealybug Balanococcus poae has been effectively managed by selection of endophytic fungi and incorporation into commercial pasture varieties. Fungal endophytes may be transferred in seed, while others are acquired from healthy soils, primarily by colonising the roots. Assay methods were developed and used. The relative susceptibility of 15 selected grass varieties to pasture mealybug was determined in screenhouse assays by infestation with the mealybug H. summervillei. Significant differences in susceptibility were detected. Mekong brizantha, Argentina bahia, curly Mitchel grass, Biloela buffel and Gatton panic were all less susceptible to mealybug than American buffel. Callide and Katambora Rhodes, Paspalum nicorae, green panic, and Gayndah buffel were all similar in susceptibility to American buffel. In sensitive, rapid and statistically robust laboratory assays, mealybugs on Gatton panic and Mekong brizantha died more rapidly and in higher proportions, and were less able to develop to maturity than on American Buffel.Assays demonstrated that the seed-born fungal endophyte Epichlo{\"e} festucae reduced the susceptibility of perennial ryegrass to the Australian pasture mealybug H. summervillei, and reduced the severity of dieback symptoms. This result provides {\textquoteleft}proof of concept{\textquoteright} of the use of endophytes, as used commercially in New Zealand against the pasture mealybug Balanococcus poae. This work demonstrates a direct link between {\textquoteleft}pasture dieback{\textquoteright}, pasture diversity and soil health. Analysis of soils sampled systematically across Queensland and New South Wales showed that severity of dieback was reduced in pastures with greater diversity of species in 5 key genera of beneficial rhizospheric-competent fungal endophytes. Abundance of these fungi was shown to be higher in trial plots planted with legumes in pasture mixes than in plots sown with pasture grasses alone. Management practices that increase diversity of beneficial rhizospheric fungi, such as inclusion of legumes, and impacts of management that reduces abundance and diversity of these fungi (such as, possibly, hot burning) requires investigation. Further research to screen varieties for tolerance/ resistance and to determine tolerance / resistance mechanisms using a combination of rapid laboratory assay method and transcriptome analysis (B.PAS 0003) are strongly recommended. Further assays and detailed analysis of plant/endophyte/mealybug interactions in grasses to should be conducted in combination with trials on pasture legume mixes is strongly recommended. The project has significantly increased options to manage pasture dieback. Tolerant and resistant pasture varieties have been identified. The benefit of both seed-born and rhizospheric fungal endophytes in reducing mealybug and pasture dieback in the laboratory and in the field has been demonstrated. Rapid assays have been developed to reduce cost and increase speed and statistical power of future screening for development of new pasture varieties and endophytic symbionts for protection of tropical and subtropical pastures.",
