The last two months have been packed with exciting scientific events, which I’d like to briefly recap here.

The first  event was the Make it Snappy challenge, held between departments at my workplace as part of National Science Week 2025. This was a fun opportunity to deliver a rapid-fire presentation in the vein of the Three Minute Thesis. Creating and rehearsing a presentation to be delivered in such a short timeframe was a new experience for me, and one that I really enjoyed. It was also fantastic to see some of the work being done by people in my office that is very different to my own.

Next up was the Avocado Production R&D Summit. I got to absorb a full day of presentations on key avocado research projects being conducted across Australia. This event did a particularly great job of approaching scientific research with an industry perspective.

Finally, I attended The Future of Hort Science Roadshow, hosted by the Australian Society of Horticultural Science with funding by the National Farmers’ Federation. I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to present at this event and even received a travel award to do so. The other presentations were excellent, and the enthusiasm for horticulture among the attendees was palpable. The event also featured a fantastic keynote presentation by Honorary Professor Daryl Joyce, whom I have been fortunate enough to work with for the past two years.
