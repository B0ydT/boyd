### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

#### **Senior Research Assistant** | QUT | Jan 2022 – Present
- Managed data curation, exploration, visualisation, and modelling across four
separate projects
- Analysed 16S metabarcoding data to investigate microbial markers of pasture
dieback
- Modelled diurnal fluctuations in bee hive temperature to isolate the
relationship between colony strength and temperature regulation
- Trained students and junior research assistants in the use of HPC
infrastructure

#### **Research Assistant** | QUT | Mar 2020 – Jan 2022
