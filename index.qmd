I lead bioinformatics and computational biology analyses as a senior research
assistant in the Invertebrate Microbiology Group at QUT. Working with ecological
datasets, high-throughput sequencing data, bioassays, and more I have the skills
to conduct complex end-to-end analyses from data cleaning to reporting. I am
comfortable with the unknown and look for opportunities to work with new types
of data and address a variety of research questions. Most of my work is
performed in R or on the command line, but I am frequently adding new tools and
methods to my workflows. I have a particular interest in microbial ecology,
having written my master’s thesis on bee symbionts, and a passion for
Australia’s natural biodiversity more generally.

This website will serve as a place to gather my work, a living CV, and
potentially a repository for thoughts too big for twitter.
