I am a senior data analyst for the Department of Primary Industries in 
Queensland, Australia. As part of the Supply Chain Innovation team, I help to 
improve the quality of fresh fruit delivered to consumers. I have a particular 
interest in microbial ecology, having written my master’s thesis on bee 
symbionts, and a passion for Australia’s natural biodiversity more generally.
