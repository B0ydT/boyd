    "title": "Beyond the Basics: Books to Supercharge Your R Skills",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are a plethora of great books that are widely recommended for the beginner R user, but I many users often find their skills plateauing once they learn just enough to get by on a day-to-day basis. These are some of the books that helped me to break through that plateau and take full advantage of R. And doesn’t it reflect well on the R community that all of these books are available for free?\n\nAdvanced R\nAdvanced R is the best one stop shop for everything about R that your introductory courses and textbooks didn’t teach you. It is a relatively dense book and, if you’re like me, it might not be immediately clear why some of the techniques and strategies are so valuable. By at least browsing the entire book, you will gain a much better understanding of what advanced programming strategies are available to you in R. If you can recognise when these techniques are needed in your own work you can revisit the relevant chapters as needed.\n\n\nThe R Inferno\nI often learn from making mistakes, fixing them, and learning to avoid them in the future. The R Inferno helped me avoid a lot of mistakes, pointing out a lot of R’s sharpest edges and how to avoid them. It is not necessarily a book that you should work through like a textbook – it is another dense book, and it helps to reflect on chapters as you work on some relevant code. This is one book that I often revisit, finding more to take away each time.\n\n\nR Packages\nGiven his massive contributions to R in general and the tidyverse, it is no surprise that Hadley Wickham is an author of two entries on this list (the other being Advanced R). Even if you don’t intend to create and publish R packages for others to use, they can be an incredibly valuable part of your workflow. Making your code portable and reusable can yield massive efficiencies, and knowing how R packages work under the hood can make debugging code or contributing to open-source software much easier. Now in its second edition, R Packages should be your go to for anything related to… R packages.\n\n\nBuilding Reproducible Analytical Pipelines With R (RAPs With R)\nThe most recently published book on this list, RAPs with R has quickly become one of my favourites, collecting some of the highest yield strategies the data scientist or analyst can implement to ensure reproducibility in their work. This is an incredibly readable book that you can sit down and work through from start to finish, following along with practical examples. The section on Git is incredibly useful for R users, who typically aren’t exposed to version control in introductory courses. RAPS with R also helps illustrate how writing functions and packages should be part of any R user’s workflow, whileI have found the section on deploying R code in docker containers particularly valuable in my own work.\n\n\nEngineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps\nThis final entry is different from the others in that I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it to every user – it is really only useful for those trying to make interactive shiny applications. That said, it is so good for that purpose that I wanted to highlight it. The golem approach to shiny applications championed by this book is a total game changer. Writing clean, modular code, and making use of the bundled deployment tools makes building interactive applications much less stressful. If you’re looking to make your R code useful to a wider audience through interactive applications, this could be a game changer."

    "title": "Three Tips for Better R Figures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently I shared my favourite ways to ensure your R plots look great in Quarto documents. Now I want to share my most commonly used tips for building effective and readable plots in R.\nAs an example dataset I’ll be using chip_dataset.csv, downloaded from Vercel. Redistribution of the dataset is not permitted.\nLet’s create a rough figure, and see how we can improve it in a few simple steps.\n\n```{r}\n#| dev: \"CairoPNG\" \n#| fig-cap: \"A rough figure\"\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nchips &lt;- read.csv(\"chip_dataset.csv\")\n\nchips &lt;- chips |&gt; \n  mutate(Date = mdy(Release.Date),\n         transistors = as.numeric(Transistors..million.)) |&gt;\n  filter(Foundry != \"\" &\n           Type == \"GPU\" &\n           !is.na(Date) &\n           !is.na(transistors))\n\nchips |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Date, \n           y = transistors, \n           color = Foundry)) +\n    geom_point()\n```\n\n\n\n\nA rough figure\n\n\n\n\n\nPick a great base theme\nWith R being more popular than ever, the default ggplot2 theme is everywhere. In addition to being overused, the grey background can be a bit much. ggplot2::theme_minimal is an easy substitute and a great base for further customisation, but I really like hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum.\n\n\nUse an effective colour palette\nEffective use of colour can ensure that your plots are able to be interpreted at a glance. The viridis palettes help to ensure that different values are distinct, and are colourblind-friendly. Like the base ggplot2 theme, viridis palettes are everywhere, but it’s a hard choice to argue with!\n\n\nModify your theme\nEven though we’ve chosen a great theme, it’s still important to consider whether it perfectly suits you needs. For example, I often like to drop the x-axis gridlines for a cleaner look. I will also place the legend below the plot, to allow the main contents to fill the page.\nWe’ll apply the tips described above, as well as rescaling the y-axis and adding some trendlines. Do you think this is a more effective figure?\n\n```{r}\n#| dev: \"CairoPNG\" \n#| label: feature-image\n#| fig-cap: \"The final figure\"\n\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(sysfonts)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nfont_add_google(\"Roboto Condensed\")\n\nchips |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = transistors, color = Foundry)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = \"H\", direction = -1) +\n  scale_y_log10(labels = label_number()) +\n  theme_ipsum_rc(axis_title_size = 12) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +\n  labs(y = \"Transistors (millions)\",\n       title = \"GPU Transistor Count by Release Date\",\n       subtitle = \"Data from https://chip-dataset.vercel.app/\")\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe final figure"

    "title": "Apply the Dracula Theme to Quarto Websites",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am something of a Dracula theme fanatic. After first discovering the open-source theme in RStudio, I had to see if it was supported by other applications. To my delight, I found custom Dracula themes for over 400 applications. Applying these themes to my OS, IDEs, browsers, and other applications is now the first thing I do when I install a new tool or set up a computer. I’ve even gone so far as to get Dracula keycaps for my mechanical keyboard.\nWhen I decided to add dark mode to my Quarto website, Dracula was the obvious choice. But, given the wide-ranging support for the theme, I was surprised to discover there was no pre-packaged Bootstrap theme which I could plug into Quarto. Of course, I wasn’t going to let that stop me!\nStarting with the Darkly theme from Bootswatch as a base, I customised the theme to incorporate the Dracula palette using the handy Bootstrap Live Customizer tool, before exporting the resulting LESS code and converting it to the SCSS required by Quarto. I had to remove a few variables which seemed to cause issues when rendering. After a few additional tweaks, I was left with a Dracula themed sight that felt like home. You can access the SCSS file here. If you’re reading this post through an aggregator, you can see it in action on my original post.\nThere are a few things to consider when adding the Dracula theme to your own Quarto site. Not all viewers prefer the dark mode experience, so I prefer to let the user decide. In the snippet from my site-wide YAML configuration below, the user is offered a choice between a light and dark mode (Darkly + Dracula), but the website defaults to the user’s system preference. I also specified a custom font to be used across both themes, as I wanted to minimize changes besides colour when switching between themes. As a final touch, specify Dracula code highlighting if you are going to be including code chunks. You may optionally include a styles.css file in the root directory of the project,\nincorporating other style changes that are applied across both themes.\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    respect-user-color-scheme: true\n    theme: \n      dark: [darkly, styles-dark.scss]\n      light: sandstone\n    header-includes: |\n      &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"screen\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Sans\" type=\"text/css\"/&gt;\n      &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"screen\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code\" type=\"text/css\"/&gt;\n    mainfont: \"Fira Sans\"\n    monofont: \"Fira Code\"\nhighlight-style: Dracula\n---\nHopefully this will be of use to some other Dracula diehards out there. I’m sure I will continue to tweak the SCSS file as I spot opportunities for improvement."

    "text": "If you regularly create Quarto documents, it s important to ensure that you can incorporate quality figures without spending a long time messing about. These are some of my favourite settings to ensure that my figures look great every time I render a Quarto document.\n\nUse showtext through Knitr\nShowtext offers better text rendering, as well as great control over settings such as DPI, which controls text size. Setting up showtext in your Quarto YAML metadata is much easier the calling showtext_begin() and showtext_end() every time you want to produce a plot!\n---\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk: \n    fig-showtext: true\n---\n\n\nUse Google Fonts with sysfonts\nSimply calling font_add_google() with your chosen Google Font will make that font available in your R session and will look excellent in your showtext-enabled plots. Using Google Fonts has the added benefit of make your code much more portable.\nLet’s load something a bit wacky:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(sysfonts)\nfont_add_google(\"Bungee Tint\", db_cache = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n\nYou may need to specify db_cache = FALSE for some fonts that have not been cached in your sysfonts install.\n\n\nSet dev options in Knitr chunks\nYou can set dev arguments in your chunks, again avoiding the (in my opinion) rather clunky dev functions. I typically use this to set a transparent background, but that’s a pretty poor example on a white page. Let’s set a solid background and see how a plot looks with our custom settings!\n\n```{r}\n#| dev.args: !expr list(bg=\"beige\")\n#| fig-cap: \"An example figure\"\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = disp,\n             y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Bungee Tint\"),\n        panel.background = element_blank(),\n        plot.background = element_blank())\n```\n\n\n\n\nAn example figure"
